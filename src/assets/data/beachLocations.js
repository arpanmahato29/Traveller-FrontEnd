        desc: 'One of the most popular beaches in North Goa, Baga Beach is located close to Calangute beach, around 30 Km North of Panjim. Baga is the perfect destination to witness the dazzling nightlife of Goa as signature places such as Britto\'s, Tito\'s and Mambos are located in the vicinity. Being one of the most visited beaches in the North, Baga also offers a vast range of water sports. Baga is so named after the "Baga creek" which flows into the Arabian Sea. It is also famous for its designer stores as well as its street-side markets. While at Baga, grab a sumptuous breakfast at Infantaria - a highly recommended eatery, relax by the beach all day, and in the evening let the party animal in you come alive. Baga Beach is considered to be the extension of Calangute Beach itself since both of these lies on the same stretch of the shore. ',

The fort is so named after the Portuguese Word for water i.e. "Agua" and used to be a replenishing source of freshwater for sailors. In fact, it has the capacity to hold 2,376,000 gallons of water and was one of the biggest freshwater reservoirs of Asia. Fort Aguada has also been used as Aguada jail. A statue in front of the jail salutes the freedom fighters, giving the fort a touch of patriotism.',
